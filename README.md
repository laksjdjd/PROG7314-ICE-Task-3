Overview
CulinaryGPT Android aims to blend AI cooking expertise with a secure login experience. The app lets users ask questions about recipes, techniques, substitutions, and meal planning. It uses a conversational interface to deliver stepwise guidance, explains reasoning when helpful, and provides links to reliable sources. The app’s core features rely on a smart integration between the client and a Cohere-based server that supports retrieval augmented generation. In simple terms, the assistant pulls relevant cooking knowledge from a curated knowledge base and augments it with AI-generated advice to answer user questions accurately and clearly.

The app prioritizes privacy and security. It supports secure Google Single Sign-On (SSO) so users can sign in with their Google accounts. Biometric authentication adds another layer of protection for sensitive user data stored on the device. The authentication flow is designed with best practices in mind, including token handling, secure storage, and minimal data exposure. The client side is implemented in Kotlin, leveraging modern Android development practices to provide a responsive and accessible experience.

Architecture and how it works
CulinaryGPT Android follows a layered architecture that separates concerns and makes it easier to test and extend. The client runs on Android and handles the UI, input, and authentication flows. The networking layer uses Retrofit to talk to a REST API that the Cohere-based RAG server exposes. The server handles knowledge retrieval, reasoning, and formatting of responses. The client presents the assistant’s replies in a chat-like interface and keeps a local history for the current session.

Client side
- Kotlin-based Android app: The user interface is implemented in Kotlin using modern Android components. The UI focuses on clarity and ease of use. The chat view presents messages with clear timestamps and avatars. The input area supports quick message composition, emoji input, and paste support for links.
- Authentication: Google Sign-In is integrated to provide a secure SSO experience. Tokens are stored securely on the device. Biometric authentication is optional and can be enabled to re-authenticate sessions without requiring passwords or sign-ins every time.
- Security: Sensitive data is stored using Android’s secure storage mechanisms. Access tokens are protected with the Keystore and are not logged. The app minimizes data exposure by fetching only the necessary information from the server and by enforcing strict authentication checks for API calls.
- Networking: The app uses Retrofit to model the API surface. OkHttp sits under Retrofit as the HTTP client, providing features like connection pooling, retries, and logging when enabled in development mode.
- Local state: The chat history is kept in memory for the session and can be persisted locally if the user enables a history backup feature. The app honours user privacy preferences and can operate in a minimal data mode if needed.

Server side (Cohere-based RAG)
- Retrieval augmented generation: The server uses a retrieval step to fetch relevant cooking knowledge from a knowledge base and then augments the prompt with this context before sending it to the language model for generation. The result is a more precise and useful answer than a generic chat bot.
- Security controls: The server accepts authenticated requests from the client, ensuring that only approved devices can access the service. Data written to the server is handled with care and kept in line with privacy expectations.
- API design: The REST interface is designed to be simple and robust. Each chat request includes the user identifier, the conversation history context, and the current user message. The server returns a structured response that includes the assistant’s reply, confidence indicators, and optional references to sources.
- Observability: The server emits logs and metrics that help diagnose issues and tune performance. This makes it easier to identify slow responses, misrouted requests, or unexpected inputs.

Security and privacy
Security is a top priority for CulinaryGPT Android. The app uses Google Sign-In for secure authentication and offers biometric protection to unlock the app and protect sensitive data. The authentication flow is designed to minimize the risk of credential leakage and to provide a smooth user experience.

- Google Sign-In (SSO): The app delegates user authentication to Google, which reduces the risk of password reuse and phishing. The client validates tokens and uses them to authorize API calls.
- Biometric protection: Users can enable biometric authentication to re-authenticate. This protects the app against unauthorized access, especially on shared devices. The biometric flow is designed to be fast and reliable across a range of devices.
- Data minimization: The app transmits only what is necessary to the server. User data is kept to a minimum and is not shared with third parties without explicit user consent.
- Token security: Tokens are stored securely using Android Keystore-backed storage. They are not logged and are removed when the user signs out or resets the app.
- Network security: All communication with the server uses HTTPS. Certificates are validated, and the app gracefully handles certificate errors and network issues.
